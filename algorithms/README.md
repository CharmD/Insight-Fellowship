This folder contains the code used to:
- query the Constant Therapy database 
- visualize the data per patient cohort 
- smoothen the response accuracy and latency curves
- select features of interest from user's demographic and baseline performance
- predict user's improvement on tasks through linear, radial SVM and random forest regression 

Python and R were both used.
